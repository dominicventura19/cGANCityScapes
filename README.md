# Objective
The purpose of this notebook was to learn and understand image to image translation using conditional GANs (cGANs). This concept was described in [Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004).

Note: GANs can take a long time to train. I did 150 epochs on my school's server that has a GPU and each epoch took roughly 2 minutes.

Plots of the generator and discriminator losses can be viewed [here] (https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/HnZe4oRhRBi3oK98evaKLg/#scalars).
